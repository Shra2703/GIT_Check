# CodeTube React-JS Project
### CodeTude Mini-project is the part of 100DaysOfCode journey in reactjs learning. This mini-project I did on days 18-19.
*This CodeTude mini-project contains the list of courses and the instructor and we can follow and unfollow the instructor as well. The Add to Cart functionality is also added with the cart count on the cart icon. Styled components are used to style the component.*
