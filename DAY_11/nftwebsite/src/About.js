          NFT means non-fungible tokens (NFTs), which are generally created
          using the same type of programming used for cryptocurrencies. In
          simple terms these cryptographic assets are based on blockchain
          technology. They cannot be exchanged or traded equivalently like other
          cryptographic assets. Like Bitcoin or Ethereum. The term NFT clearly
          represents it can neither be replaced nor interchanged because it has
          unique properties. Physical currency and cryptocurrency are fungible,
          which means that they can be traded or exchanged for one another.
          Immerse yourself in the revolutionary world of NFTs while building a
          robust foundation in cybersecurity through our dedicated cyber
          security bootcamp.
